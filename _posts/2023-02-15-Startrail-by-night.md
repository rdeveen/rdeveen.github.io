A composite of 50 photos from the dark sky above the Utrechtse Heuvelrug. The photos were taken at 24mm, f/2.8, ISO 100 and 30 seconds. The photos were stacked and edited in Photoshop. The final image was processed in Adobe Lightroom.

The man standing in the dark, that is me. I was standing there for 25 minutes in the cold and the dark. I was looking at the stars and the airplanes flying by. I was thinking about the universe and the meaning of life. No kidding, I was standing there just for 1 or 2 photo's and then moved back out of the frame.
