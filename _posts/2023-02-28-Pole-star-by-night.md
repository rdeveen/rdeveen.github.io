A composite of 70 photos from the dark sky above the Utrechtse Heuvelrug shot directly to the North. In the middle, you see the pole star and all the other stars dancing around. The straight lines are airplanes flying by and sending their Morse code to the audience on the ground. The photos were taken at 24mm, f/2.8, ISO 100, and 30 seconds. The photos were stacked and edited in Photoshop. The final image was processed in Adobe Lightroom.

### Or as ChatGPT would say:

"The composite image capturing the dark sky above the Utrechtse Heuvelrug is a testament to the boundless wonders of the universe. It combines the natural splendor of star trails with the fleeting messages transmitted by airplanes, creating a poetic narrative etched across the canvas of the night sky. Through technical precision and creative vision, the photographer has gifted us a glimpse into the awe-inspiring beauty that lies just beyond our reach. So, next time you find yourself beneath a starlit sky, take a moment to appreciate the celestial symphony unfolding above, and perhaps, you too will capture your own unique piece of stardust."
