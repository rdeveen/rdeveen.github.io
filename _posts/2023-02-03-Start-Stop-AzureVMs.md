# Start/Stop Azure VMs during off-hours — The Logic App Solution

Virtual machines in a Cloud are most of their time not productively and waiting for some jobs to do. Especially during off-hours when the offices are closed and the people are sleeping at their homes.

Azure Virtual Machines have the capability to Auto-shutdown at a specific time of the day. This can be configured in the Azure Portal but there is no easy way to configure it to Auto-startup at a specific time of the day.
